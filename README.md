Classification of Heart Diseases using ECG Signals
Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide. Early diagnosis and treatment of these diseases can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality rates. Electrocardiography (ECG) is a widely-used method for diagnosing heart diseases, as it provides information about the electrical activity of the heart. In this project, we present a machine learning approach for classifying heart diseases using ECG signals.

Data
The data for this project consists of ECG recordings from a diverse set of patients, including individuals with and without heart diseases. 

Methodology
We developed a machine learning model to classify heart diseases using ECG signals. Our model consists of a combination of feature extraction and classification steps.

Feature Extraction
The first step in our model is to extract relevant features from the ECG signals. We used a combination of hand-crafted and learned features for this purpose. Hand-crafted features included statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, and skewness, as well as frequency-domain features such as power spectral density. We also used learned features, such as those obtained from convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to capture more complex patterns in the ECG signals.

Classification
Once the features have been extracted, we used a variety of classifiers to predict the presence or absence of heart diseases. We compared the performance of several classifiers, including support vector machines (SVMs), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and random forests.

Results
We evaluated the performance of our model using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. Our model achieved an overall accuracy of 85% on the test set, with a precision of 87% and a recall of 84%.

Conclusion
In this project, we presented a machine learning approach for classifying heart diseases using ECG signals. Our model achieved high accuracy and demonstrated the potential of using machine learning for early diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
